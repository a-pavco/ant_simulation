# ant_simulation
Master thesis - Ant simulation

The goal is to plausibly simulate and control a walking ant.
Implemented using Gazebo 9, ROS Melodic Morenia and catkin.

status: 1/2019 - writing thesis document, building URDF model of an ant for purposes of ROS control

status: 12/2018 - using catkin, ROS package, moving ant with gazebo plugin and python script using rostopic

status: 5/2018 - complete SDF model of ant with visual, collision, 
                 inertial data and some joints
